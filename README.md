# OlaRide-ETL-Analysis 


This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data by implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using MySQL and visualizing key insights with Power BI. This project aims to demonstrate how SQL is used to analyze data efficiently, enabling deeper insights into ride trends and operational performance.

## Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to analyze ride trends, cancellations, and customer-driver behavior in Ola rides by leveraging MySQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization. 

- Understanding Ride Trends: Analyze booking patterns, ride distances, and peak hours.
- Identifying Cancellation Reasons: Investigate cancellations by both customers and drivers.
- Customer & Driver Insights: Study customer ratings, payment preferences, and driver performance.
- Enhancing Data Quality: Normalize and structure raw data into a relational model (3NF) for efficient querying.
- Visualizing Key Metrics: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards for better decision-making.

### Process Framework
Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process I followed to create the Power BI dashboard.

#### 1. Data Extraction
- Downloaded the Ola ride dataset from Kaggle.

#### 2. Data Loading
- Loaded raw data into a MySQL database for structured storage and querying.

#### 3. Data Transformation
- Performed data cleaning, normalization (3NF), and structuring using SQL.
- Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and ensured relational integrity.

#### 4. Data Analysis
- Used SQL queries to analyze ride trends, cancellations, payment methods, and customer-driver behavior.
- Explored metrics such as ride distance, booking values

#### 5. Data Visualization
- Created Power BI dashboards to visualize key insights.
Designed reports on ride cancellations, booking patterns, and customer trends.
